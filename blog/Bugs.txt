Home App:
  Add two stores
  add in the profile page that shows all the user's information where you can change the values
  get the tracking ID when you finish a payment
  When a user logs into their account, they do not get their name back
  When a user is typing in the credit card number, it takes in more numbers than it should because it is not taking into account the spacing
  finish adding all the tracking functionality
  add header bar to the payment page
  instead of saying the marketplace on the login page, it should say the group name
  update expiration date
  don't let the shopping cart continue if there are no items in the cart
  when I set the category up as vegetables and search for carrots, it doesnt show up

Admin App:
  add in the admin login page
  after admin logs in, send it to a set of pages only the admin can access
    each page checks Cookie and sees if the admin is located in it
      if it is not the admin, display that only the admin can access these pages
  add in the page that allows you to update the database and change all the values
    has a "Submit" button on the bottom of the page that sends all the updates to the database


When we are finally finished with everything:
  remove all the alerts
  if nothing shows up for the search, display that the searched item does not exist in our store
  after we click the submit button on the send message button on the contact page, it should do something
